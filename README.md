# Run Frontend
* In local machine
```
cd frontend
npm start # npm run dev to debug
```

* Run in a docker container
```
docker compose up
```
> To install `docker-compose`, visit https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Note:
> To change between `production/stage`, in `docker-compose.yml` file, change app target between `production/dev` respectively. 


# Run Backend
First, create a `.env` file in this directory (that is, in the same level as `docker-compose.yml`) with the following content, which must be updated with the proper values:
```
POSTGRES_USER=...
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
POSTGRES_DB=...
DATABASE_URL=postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@db:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}
```

* Run in a docker container => same as for frontend

# Accessing django-based admin page for managing data
Once the app is running, you connect to the backend docker service (see [`docker compose exec backend sh`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/exec/)) and run the following instructions:
* ``python3 manage.py makemigrations``
* ``python3 manage.py migrate``
* create a new superuser with `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`, and access the admin page generated by Django in `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.
